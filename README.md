## To do list for M3
I made a To Do list for the stuff that we have to do for Milestone 3. These are just ideas of what should be on each page based on what we talked about a while ago so if you want to change them, go ahead. Also, add anything that I'm missing or that I got wrong
Also if anyone has questions about the extent of the functionality just ask on the groupme and we can come up with a list of functionality questions that we need to ask her since most of this stuff doesnt really need to work fully.

- [ ] **Milestone 3 website**
          I'm not really sure what the extent of this is so i don't really know how many people need to work on this part

- [ ] **Video and script** (I think we decided that all of us shuold work on this part?) 

- [ ] **Testing Plan for the next Milestone** (I'm not sure what this is exactly but I think it was somewhere on the M3 instructions) 

- [ ] **Homepage**
         Should just be HTML and CSS stuff
         
- [ ] **Immediate Help button**
          clicking the help button should create a pop up or something else that will get the users attention that gives the user a fake phone number or something like that. we need to add this to all the pages and. I'm pretty sure this can be done with a few lines of javascript to make an alert box
          
- [ ] **Informative Resources**
          Add 6 static HTML pages that have information about each of the items on the dropdown from the nav bar. Whoever does this can add, remove, or change any of the resources from the list but make sure that you change them on all the pages. Also, the pages that these dropdown items connect to need to be added to the href part of the nav bar for each item on all the current pages. 
          
 
- [ ] **Help Near You**
        the user Should be able to give in input like a zip code which should give them a map or just a list of doctors/therapists near them that can help them with the fake name, address and maybe a phone number. This shouldnt need to function, it should be fine if the list is the same no matter what the user types but I'll make with the prof just incase  

- [ ] **Chat Bot** - Kirtana (I have a bit of functional code for this but its not that great so if anyone else wants to work on this instead of mr, I'm good with that)
        This basically just goes through a loop of things that the chat bot says everytime no matter what the user inputs, I don't think it needs to function more than that but I'll ask the prof in case. If anyone wants to make this more complex just for fun or you just want to work on this part let me know.

- [ ] **Search** 
        This should give the user a list of links about whatever they search. I'm not sure if we actually need this feature since it's basically a google search? This also shuold not need to function, a list of links and descriptions that always shows up  regradless of the user input should be fine. We might need to add a button next to the search box to make it function but that would need to be added to every page.
