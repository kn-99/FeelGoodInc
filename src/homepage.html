		<h2>About Us:</h2>
		<p> We at FeelGoodInc. have one goal: to help those suffering from mental illnesses in any way that we can.
		We have many features throughout our website that aim to do just that. For instance, in our Informative Resources tab we offer a multitude of helpful 
		resources for individuals afflicted from metal illnesses and for people that simply want to become more aquainted with the illnesses.
		This tab also offers resources for these individuals to request financial assistance or to look for new treatments and even to find support groups.
		Additionally, the Help Near You tab allows a user to enter their zip code and receive resources that are located around their general area. Another great
		feature of our website is the Chat Bot we have implemented. This chat bot can serve many roles such as simply being someone the user can communicate with to a 
		correspondent that helps individuals receive the correct resources and information. Moreover, we have implemented the Get Help Now button that immidiately connects 
		the user to a safe mental illness support group where they can talk to a human and receive guidence and understanding. We hope that our website makes a difference and
		is able to help people that need it.
